GameLog
[
    ...entry...
]
every line of a log is considered an entry
every entry ends with a semicolon (';')
there are two types of the entries: normal ones and special ones
* normal entry is just the serialized ply (see above), followed by a semicolon
* special entries start with '#', followed by one-letter code, describing the type of an entry, and '|'
  after the pipe character follow the entry's args, separated with '/', except for the '#P|' entry, where args are separated using ':'
  the possible types of the special entries are:
  * P - lists the logins of the players. 
      Usually it is the first line of a log
      The first arg is the white player's login, whereas the second arg is the one of a black player
      Logins are separated with a colon
    example: #P|whitePlayer:blackPlayer;
  * R - describes the outcome of a game and its reason
      Usually it is the last line of a log
      Because of that, it is the only entry not to be followed by a semicolon
      The first arg is an one-character code, which describes the outcome of a game:
      * w - white won
      * b - black won
      * d - draw
      The second arg is the three characters encoding the reason of a specified outcome:
      * unk - unknown reason (the game was played before the server started to log the reason)
      * mat - mate
      * bre - breakthrough
      * tim - timeout
      * res - resignation
      * abo - abortment
      * aba - abandon (should be unused normally due to a game's logic)
      * agr - agreement
      * rep - threefold repetition
      * 100 - a hundred move rule
    example: #R|w/bre
    example: #R|d/100
  * E - describes the event
      The first arg is the three-character event code followed by the arbitrary amount of event args
      Players are referred by they color codes (i. e. 'w' or 'b')
      There are the following events (args are listed in brackets in order):
      * dcn - Disconnection (disconnected player)
      * rcn - Reconnection (reconnected player)
      * dof - Draw offered
      * dca - Draw cancelled
      * dac - Draw accepted
      * dde - Draw declined
      * tof - Takeback offered
      * tca - Takeback cancelled
      * tac - Takeback accepted
      * tde - Takeback declined
    example: #E|rcn/b;
    example: #E|tof;
  * C - describes the chat message
      The first arg is the message author's color code ('w' or 'b')
      The second arg is the message text
    example: #C|b/Hello! This is the message;
